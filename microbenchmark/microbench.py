"""
This script exercises a few common linear algebra operations in numpy.
It's intended mostly to gauge whether it makes sense to descend into
compiler optimizations for the Python binary that we ship within the SIF images,
but it can be easily repurposed for other specific microbenchmarks (i.e., numba or GPU perf gains).

Be aware that here we're profiling simple operations; it would make sense to carefully
profile the libraries of interest to see where the computational bottlenecks really are.

Usage:

singularity exec clustbench-vanilla.sif python3 microbench.py
singularity exec clustbench-optimized.sif python3 microbench.py
